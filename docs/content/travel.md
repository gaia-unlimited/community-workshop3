You may need to apply for a visa to enter the Netherlands. See this overview of [visa requirements](https://www.government.nl/topics/immigration-to-the-netherlands/question-and-answer/which-visa-do-i-need-to-travel-to-the-netherlands).

Feel free to contact the organizers if you need a letter of support.

## Getting to Turin

### <i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Driving directions

In the center of Leiden you can only park in a parking garage or in one of the very limited paid parking spaces on the street (and then you must pay for a full day regardless of how long you park). Check with your hotel to make sure that they have available parking.
